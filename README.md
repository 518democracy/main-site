# 518democracy.top

We are Year 8 students and decided to make a dedicated website for the 5.18 Gwangju Uprising.

This project is an open-source project, and everyone can use it to make their own personal Gwangju Uprising website.

# What we used

We used Notion (notion.so) and Cloudflare Workers to make our website.

The original Notion page URL is https://518democracy.notion.site/518democracy-top-8e8de561e4a542fcb8631d3a355935f6

And by accessing this URL, everyone can duplicate our Notion page and make it into a website.


## Demo

https://518democracy.top


## FAQ

#### How did you make Notion page into a website?

The simple answer, we used fruitionsite.com, which provides free Notion to Website by using Cloudflare Workers.

The script is available in the source code in case if anyone wants to have a try.

#### Any video references?

We have our video/picture references on Bibliography page.
